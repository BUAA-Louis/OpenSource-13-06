After finished reading the paper "the Cathedral and the Bazaar" I now think even better of the open source projects , and their community. 

	Open source software is computer software with it's source code made available and licensed with a license in whitch the copyright holder provides the rights to study , change and distribute the software at no cost for anyone and for any purpose.

	Open source software is very open developed in public , collaborative manner. In the open source community , the collaborative members could be testers or  co-developers , most of them are actually users of the software.

	To start a new open source project , firstly you must know what are you going to do , I mean , the purpose of the software . Or you really need a kind of software to resolve your problems  . Just like the saying "every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch".

	So,how to start ? do you have to start a totally new project ?  the answer is no . "Good programmers know what to write, Great ones know what to rewrite(and reuse)'.  Therefore , you can just search the internet to see if there are already some good solutions.  You can start your program based on some other's ideas , or just play as a co-developer to add the functions those you need to resolve your problems.

	You always can't have all of them when there are more than one good ideas to be based on.  usually you must choose only one.  Or if you meet with a batter project when you already have started developing based on an other project ,  you must make a quick decision at that time.   plan to throw one away ; you will any how".

	When you take ownership of a open source project ,  it is your call that how the project goes. So you must learn how to threat your users .  "treat your users as co-developers is your least hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective " , you have to treat your users as co-developers. so that they will give you precious suggestions  , and report the bugs. "Given enough eyeballs , all bugs are shallow".  The scaled users could help you to against the system complexity.

	In open source communities , all collaborators are volunteers , so are you .  So there is a possibility that you don't want to continue your project due to some reasons . In this situation , you must show some responsibility.  "when you lose interest in a program , your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor" .  the project is like your child , witch you don't want it to die because of your departure.
	
	Open source softwares are becoming more and more important these years , there are a lot of very famous and widely used Open Source software.  It's easy to list some of them: linux , kvm hadoop , apache  , etc.  In my company , we use java , resin , maven , linux , nginx  to provide stable and high concurrence web services .  All of them are open source projects.  As we can see , open source in very strong nowadays ,  and I have full confidence that it will become even stronger.

The artical you wrote told us Open Source software are wildly used, that is why we spent a whole day to know better about Open Source. I hope you can enjoy the journey of using the Open Source projects to resolve you daily problem.
